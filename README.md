# MudiNetCraft_Connect_Portal
MudiNetCraft is a collaborative project done by the ProtoMinds. As students of the university of venda, we saw how poor connectivity disrupts learning,assessments and communication. so we decided to cretae a plartform that monitors network reliability in key campus areas and helps students, staff and admins detect, report, and manage connectivity.
